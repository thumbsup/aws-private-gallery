# AWS private static gallery

> One-click deployment of your static Thumbsup gallery to AWS

Features:

- Custom domain name
- CDN caching
- HTTPS / TLS
- User authentication

It is designed to have:

- `minimal infrastructure`: no servers or databases to maintain
- `low cost`: the website is served from cache (even private content!)
- `invite-only`: you can control who has access
- `flexible`: can login with email/password, or using social logins
- `self managed`: users can reset their own passwords

## Intro

There are 4 main AWS components involved:

- [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) to store the website (HTML, CSS, media...)
- [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) to provide caching and edge-authentication
- [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito) to manage users and authentication
- [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) to validate Cognito tokens and create [CloudFront signed cookies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html)

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for more details about how the site is setup.

This repo is meant to provide a bootstrap for your private gallery.
Cognito is very flexible, and you will probably want to tweak a few settings once deployed.
For example, you might want to:

- customise the login page with a logo
- allow self sign-ups with an approval workflow
- enable social logins with Google or Facebook

## Setup

### 1. Configure this repo

Before you setup the gallery, you will need to clone and adjust the following files:

| Template | Expected name | Content |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| [lambda/whitelist/emails.js.example](lambda/whitelist/emails.js.example) | `lambda/whitelist/emails.js` | List of email addresses that can access the gallery |
| [infra/terraform.tfvars.example](infra/terraform.tfvars.example) | `infra/terraform.tfvars` | S3 bucket name, domain name... |
| [infra/backend.tf.example](infra/backend.tf.example) | `infra/backend.tf` | Terraform state storage |
| [infra/templates/email-invite.html.example](infra/templates/email-invite.html.example) | `infra/templates/email-invite.html` | Email template |

### 2. Create the TLS certificate for your domain

Create a TLS certificate in [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm).
Regardless of any other settings, the certificate must be created  in `us-east-1` (North Virginia).
Follow the prompts to validate the domain by email or DNS.

### 3. Build the Lambda functions

The login/whitelist functions are written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org),
built and packaged inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
The following will create the ZIP files which are needed for the next step.

```bash
cd lambda
./build.sh
```

### 4. Setup your CloudFront private key

Authentication relies on cookies signed with a key pair.
This is a sensitive value, so the stack expects it to be stored encrypted in
[SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html).

First, generate a new key pair locally:

``` bash
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

Then store the public key on CloudFront:

1. Open the CloudFront UI
2. Navigate to "Key management", then "Public keys"
3. Upload the public key, and take note of the Key ID you receive
4. Navigate to the "Key group" section just underneath
5. Create a new key group which includes the public key above

Then store the values in Parameter Store:

1. Open the Parameter Store UI
2. Create the 2 following entries:

| Name | Type | KMS Key ID | Value | Example |
|------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| `cloudfront_keypair_id`  | `String` | - | Public ID of the key pair | `ABC123456789` |
| `cloudfront_private_key` | `Secure String` | `alias/aws/ssm` | Contents of the private key | `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`<br />`...`<br/>`-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` |

You should then delete the private key you have downloaded.
AWS recommends rotating this key pair every 3 months.

*Note:* the Parameter Store values are cached in the Lambda function to speed up invocation.
When you rotate the key pair, the old value will still be used until the next **Lambda cold start**.
You can re-deploy the Lambda function to force a cold-start.

### 4. Deploy infrastructure

The whole infrastructure is written as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) templates.
First, authenticate against AWS with the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cliâ€Ž):

- run `aws configure` and enter the access key and secret key
- if you saved your credentials as a non-default profile, run `export AWS_PROFILE=profile_name`
- select the target AWS region using `export AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2`

Then simply run the following commands to create the infrastructure:

```bash
cd infra
terraform apply
```

If you make any subsequent changes, simply re-run `terraform apply` to apply the update.

!!NOTE!! The code has not yet been updated to take advantage of CloudFront Keypairs.
Once deployed, you must:

- go into the CloudFront distribution
- edit the "behaviours" section for **HTML** and **Default**
- update `Trusted authorization type` from `Self` to the keygroup you created above

### 6. Create users

The final step is to create a user so you can go through the login page.

- Navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito
- Click "Browse your user pools"
- Select the pool that was created by Terraform
- Click "Users and groups", then "Create user"
- Provide an email address and temporary password

### That's it!

You should now be able to browse to https://your-gallery.com and be prompted to login.

It's time to upload your gallery to the bucket defined in `infra/terraform.tfvars`.
The simplest way is using the CLI with `aws s3 sync`, e.g.

```bash
aws s3 sync ./gallery s3://my-gallery
```
